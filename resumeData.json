Used Python and R to develop an algorithm that uses a Covariance Regression Network model to express gene level effect measurements as a function of tissue-specific co-expression adjacency matrices. Used a composite likelihood estimator to rank tissues in order of relevance to certain disease traits. Improved runtime efficiency by creating a Minimum Spanning Tree of the co-expression network to identify hubs and reduce the number of candidate genes."

The model analyzes Jira tickets in real time to perform end-to-end hyper-tuning. Used Python, SQL, and Gemma-7b to create document embeddings, store them in a database, query relevant document chunks, and generate user-friendly output. Used React and Tailwind to build a front-end for document upload and querying. The product is expected to increase software development efficiency by 25% and reduce human errors by 35%."
